Attributed capital is a non-GAAP measure. \\n\\nEffective November 1, 2023, in line with OSFI’s increased Domestic Stability Buffer announced requirements, the Bank increased the capital attributed \\nto its business lines to approximate 11.5% of the Basel III common equity capital requirements.

Diluted  earnings  per  share  (EPS)  were  $1.57 , compared  to $1.68  in the  same  period  a year  ago . \\nAdjusted  net  income(1) for  the  second  quarter  was  $2,105  million  and  adjusted  diluted  EPS(1) was  $1.58 , down  from  $1.69  last  year.  Adjusted  return  on \\nequity(1) was  11.3 % compared  to 12.3%  a year  ago . \\n“The  Bank  delivered  solid  results  this  quarter  against  a backdrop  of ongoing  macroeconomic  uncertainty,  reporting  positive  operating  leverage  driven  by \\nrevenue  growth  and  continued  expense  discipline.  We  are  executing  on our  commitment  to balanced  growth  as our  deposit  momentum  continues,  while  \\nmaintaining  strong  capital  and  liquidity  metrics,”  said  Scott  Thomson,  President  and  CEO  of Scotiabank.  “I am  prou d to see  Scotiabankers  across  our  \\nglobal  footprint  rallying  behind  our  new  strategy  and  coming  together  to drive  our  key  strategic  initiatives  forward .” \\nCanadian  Banking  delivered  adjusted  earnings(1) of $1 billion  this  quarter.  Solid  revenue  growth  outpaced  expense  growth  resulting  in another  quarter  of \\npositive  operating  leverage,  while  provision  for  credit  losses  increased  compared  to the  prior  year.  In addition,  deposit  growth,  a key  component  of the  \\nrefreshed  strategy,  was  up  7%  year over year . \\nInternational  Banking  generated  adjusted  earnings(1) of $701  million.  Revenue  growth  driven  by strong  margin  expansion , disciplined  expense  and  capital  \\nmanagement,  were  offset  by higher  provision  for  credit  losses.  Adjusted  return  on equity(1) was  14.5%,  a 120  basis  point  improvement  from  last  year . \\nGlobal  Wealth  Management  adjusted  earnings(1) were  $389  million,  up 8% year  over  year.  Assets  under  management(2) of $349  billion  increased  by 6%  \\nresulting  in strong  revenue  growth , partly  offset  by investments  to support  long term  business  growth . \\nGlobal  Banking  and  Markets  reported  earnings  of $428  million,  up  7%  compared  to the  prior  year.  Results  were  supported  by higher  fee based  revenue  \\nand  lower  provision  for  credit  losses . \\nThe  Bank  reported  a Common  Equity  Tier  1 (CET1)  capital  ratio(3) of 13.2%,  up  from  12.3%  last  year . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(1) Refer  to Non GAAP  Measures  section  starting  on  page  6.  \\n(2) Refer  to page  55 of the  Management’s  Discussion  & Analysis  in the  Bank’s Second  Quarter  2024  Report  to Shareholders,  available  on  www.sedar plus.ca,  for  an explanation  \\nof the  composition  of the  measure.

The  \\nBank  adopted  IFRS  17 on a retrospective  basis,  restating  the  results  from  the  transition  date  of November  1, 2022.  Accordingly,  results  for  fiscal  2023  have  \\nbeen  restated  to reflect  the  IFRS  17 basis  of accounting  for  insurance  contracts.

The  decrease  was  due  \\nprimarily  to higher  provision  for  credit  losses  and  non interest  expenses,  partly  offset  by higher  revenues .  \\nQ2  2024  vs Q1 2024   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  decreased  $87  million  or 8%.  The  decrease  was  due primarily  to lower  revenues  from  two  fewer  days  in the  \\nquarter,  higher  provision  for  credit  losses  and  an increase  in non interest  expenses .  \\nYear todate  Q2  2024  vs Year todate  Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $2,103  million  comp ared  to $2,141  million.  Adjusted  net  income  was  $2,104  million,  a decrease  of $39  \\nmillion  or 2%.  The  decrease  was  due  primarily  to higher  provision  for  credit  losses  and  non interest  expenses,  partly  offset  by higher  revenues .  \\nInternational  Banking   \\nQ2  20 24 vs Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  increased  $35  million  to $671  million.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  increased  $33  million  \\nto $677  million.  The  increase  was  driven  by higher  net  interest  income  and  the  positive  impact  of foreign  currency  translation . This  was  partly  offset  by \\nhigher  provision  for  credit  losses,  non interest  expenses,  provision  for  income  taxes,  and  lower  non interest  income .  \\nQ2  2024  vs Q1 2024   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  decrease d by $75  million  or 10%.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  decreased  by $75  million  \\nor 10%.  The  decrease  was  due  primarily  to lower  non interest  income,  higher  provision  for  income  taxes  and  the  negative  impact  of foreign  currency  \\ntranslat ion.  This  was  partly  offset  by lower  non interest  expenses,  higher  net  interest  income  despite  the  impact  from  two  fewer  days  in the  quarter,  and  \\nlower  provision  for  credit  losses .  \\nYear todate  Q2  2024  vs Year todate  Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $1,417  million,  an increase  of 11%  from  $1,280  million.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  \\nwas  $1,429  million,  an increase  of $134  million  or 10%.  The increase  was  driven  by higher  net  interest  income,  non interest  income,  and  the  positive  \\nimpact  of foreign  currency  translation.  This  was  partly  offset  by higher  provision  for  credit  losses,  non interest  expenses  and  provision  for  income  taxes .  \\n  \\nScotiabank  Second  Quarter  Press  Release  2024    3 Financial  Performance  on  a Constant  Dollar  Basis   \\nThe  discussion  below  on the  results  of operations  is on a constant  dollar  basis.  Under  the  constant  dollar  basis,  prior  period  amounts  are  recalculated  using  \\ncurrent  period  average  foreign  currency  rates,  which  is a non GAAP  financial  measure  (refer  to Non GAAP  Measures  starting  on page  6). The  Bank  believes  \\nthat  constant  dollar  is useful  for  readers  in assessing  ongoing  business  performance  without  the  impact  of foreign  currency  translation  and  is used  by \\nmanagement  to assess  the  performance  of the  busines s segment.  \\nQ2  2024  vs Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $671  million  and  adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $677  million,  down  $12  million  or \\n2%.  The  decrease  was  driven  by higher  provision  for  credit  losses,  lower  non interest  income,  higher  non interest  expenses  and  provision  for  income  \\ntaxes,  partly  offset  by higher  net  interest  income .  \\nQ2  2024  vs Q1 2024   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  decreased  by $62  million  or 8%.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  decreased  by $62  million  or \\n8%.  The  decrease  was  due  primarily  to lower  non interest  income  and  higher  provision  for  income  taxes,  partly  offset  by higher  net  interest  income  and  \\nlower  non interest  expenses .  \\nYear todate  Q2  2024  vs Year todate  Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $1,417  million,  an increase  of 2%  from  $1,384  million.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  \\nwas  $1,429  million,  an increase  of $31  million  or 2%.  The  increase  was  driven  by higher  net  interest  income,  partly  offset  by higher  provision  for  credit  \\nlosses,  lower  non interest  income , and  higher  non interest  expenses  and  provision  for  income  taxes .  \\nGlobal  Wealth  Management   \\nQ2  2024  vs Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $380  million,  up  $27  million  or 8%.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $387  million,  up \\n$28  million  or 8%.  The  increase  was  due  primarily  to higher  brokerage  revenues  in Canada  and  higher  mutual  fund  fees  in International  We alth,  \\nparticularly  within  Mexico.  This  was  partly  offset  by higher  non interest  expenses  due  largely  to volume related  expenses .  \\nQ2  2024  vs Q1 2024   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  increased  $12  million  or 3%.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  increased  $13  million  or 3%,  due  \\nprimarily  to higher  brokerage  revenues  and  mutual  fund  fees  across  the  Canadian  and  International  businesses,  partly  offset  by higher  non interest  \\nexpenses .  \\nYear todate  Q2  2024  vs Year todate  Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $748  million,  up  $10  million  or 1%.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $761  million,  up \\n$10  million  or 1%.  The  increase  was  due  primarily  to higher  brokerage  revenues  in Canada  and  higher  mutua l fund  fees  in International  Wealth,  particularly  \\nwithin  Mexico.  This  was  partly  offset  by higher  non interest  expenses  due  largely  to volume related  expenses .  \\nGlobal  Banking  and  Markets   \\nQ2  2024  vs Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $428  million,  an increase  of $27  million  or 7%.  This  increase  was  due  mainly  to higher  non interest  income  \\nand  lower  provision  for  credit  losses  and  provision  for  income  taxes,  partly  offset  by higher  non interest  expenses  and  lower  net  interest  income.   \\nQ2  2024  vs Q1 2024   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  decreased  by $11  million  or 3%,  due  mainly  to lower  non interest  and  net  interest  income,  partly  offset  by lower  \\nnon interest  expenses  and  provision  for  income  taxes .  \\nYear todate  Q2  2024  vs Year todate  Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  $867  million,  a decrease  of $53  million  or 6%,  due  to lower  net  interest  income  and  higher  non interest  \\nexpenses,  partly  offset  by lowe r provision  for  credit  losses  and  provision  for  income  taxes .  \\nOther   \\nQ2  2024  vs Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  a net  loss  of $421  million,  compared  to a net  loss  of $323  million  last  year.  The  higher  loss  of $98  million  was  \\ndue  mai nly  to lower  revenues,  partly  offset  by lower  non interest  expenses.   The  decrease  in revenue  was  due  mainly  to higher  funding  costs,  partly  offset  \\nby higher  income  from  liquid  assets  and  a lower  taxable  equivalent  basis  (TEB)  gross up  as the  Bank  no longe r claims  the  dividend  received  deduction  on \\nCanadian  shares  that  are  mark tomarket  property.  The  TEB  gross up  is offset  in income  taxes .  \\nQ2  2024  vs Q1 2024   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  increased  $53  million  from  the  prior  quarter  due  mainly  to higher  revenues  and  lower  non interest  expenses,  \\npartly  offset  by higher  income  taxes.  The  increase  in revenue  was  due  mainly  to higher  investment  gains,  lower  funding  costs,  and  a lower  TEB  gross up  as \\nthe  Bank  no longer  claims  the  dividend  received  deduction  on Canadian  shares  that  are  mark tomarket  property.  The  TEB  gross up  is offset  in income  \\ntaxes.  There  was  also  lower  income  from  liquid  assets  due  primarily  to two  fewer  days  in the  quarter .  \\nYear todate  Q2  2024  vs Year todate  Q2  2023   \\nNet  income  attributable  to equity  holders  was  a net  loss  of $895  million  compared  to a net  loss  of $1,236  million.  Adjusted  net  income  attributable  to \\nequity  holders  was  a net  loss  of $895  million  compared  to a net  loss  of $657  million.  This  was  due  mainly  to lower  revenues,  partly  offset  by lower  non \\ninterest  exp enses.  The  decrease  in revenue  was  due  primarily  to higher  funding  costs  and  lower  investment  gains,  which  were  partly  offset  by higher  \\nincome  from  liquid  assets  and  a lower  TEB  gross up,  as the  Bank  no longer  claims  the  dividend  received  deduction  on Cana dian  shares  that  are  mark to\\nmarket  property.

This  was  partly  offset  by migration  to impaired  in retail  portfolios  mainly  in Canada,  Mexico  and  Peru,  and  the  \\nrelatively  more  favourable  macroeconomic  outlook  impacting  most  retail  portfolios . \\nThe  provision  for  credit  losses  on impaired  loans  was  $975  million,  compared  to $621  million,  an increase  of $354  million  due  primarily  to higher  \\nformations  in International  Banking  retail  portfolios,  mostly  in Colombia,  Chile  and  Peru,  as a result  of inflation  and  interest  rate  levels  in these  markets  in \\nthe  prior  year.  There  were  also  higher  provisions  in the  Canadian  Banking  retail  portfolios,  primarily  auto  loans  and  unsecured  lines.

This  was  partly  offset  by credit  migration  to impaired  in the retail  portfolios . \\nProvision  for  credit  losses  on impaired  loans  was  $1,917  million  compared  to $1,183  million,  an increase  of $734  million,  due  primarily  to higher  \\nformations  in the  International  Banking  retail  portfolios,  mostly  in Colombia,  Chile  and  Peru,  as a result  of inflation  and  interest  rate  levels  in these  markets  \\nin the  prior  year,  as well  as higher  provisions  in Canadian  Banking.

The  allowance  for credit  losses  on loans  was  $6,507  million,  an increase  of $179  million  from  the  prior  \\nquarter.  Allowances  were  higher  due  to provisions  in Canadian  Banking  retail  portfolios,  mainly  in mortgages  and  unsecured  lines,  and  the  impact  of the  \\nmacroeconomic  outlook  impacting  commercial  portfolios.  The  impact  of foreign  currency  translation  increased  the  allowance  by $85  million .  \\nThe  allowance  against  performing  loans  was  higher  at $4,507  million  compared  to $4,424  million  last  quarter.

Allowances  were  driven  by provisions  in Canadian  Banking  retail  portfolios  mainly  in residential  mortgages  and  unsecured  lines,  \\nthe  continued  unfavourable  macroeconomic  outlook  impacting  the  commercial  portfolios,  and  portfolio  growth.  This  was  partly  offset  by credit  migration  \\nto impaired  in the  retail  portfolios,  mainly  in Mexico  and  Peru.  The  impact  of foreign  currency  translation  increased  the  allowance  by $51  million . \\nThe  allowance  on impaired  loans  increased  to $2,000  million  from  $1,904  million  last  quarter.  The  allowance  for  impaired  loans  ratio  was  27 basis  \\npoints,  an increase  of two  basis  points.  The  increase  was  due  primarily  to higher  provisions  relating  to retail  portfolios  credit  migration,  and  the  negativ e \\nimpact  of foreign  currency  translation.

Some  of these  \\nfinancial  measures  and  ratios  are  presented  on a non GAAP  basis  and  are  not  calculated  in accordance  with  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  \\n(GAAP),  which  are  based  on International  Financial  Repor ting  Standards  (IFRS)  as issued  by the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB),  are  not  \\ndefined  by GAAP  and  do  not  have  standardized  meanings  and  therefore  might  not  be comparable  to similar  financial  measures  and  ratios  disclosed  by \\nother  issuers.  The  Bank  believes  that  non GAAP  measures  and  ratios  are  useful  as they  provide  readers  with  a better  understanding  of how  management  \\nassesses  performance.  These  non GAAP  measures  and  ratios  are  used  throughout  this  press  release  and  defined  below.   \\nAdjust ed results  and  diluted  earnings  per  share   \\nManagement  considers  both  reported  and  adjusted  results  and  measures  useful  in assessing  underlying  ongoing  business  performance.  Adjusted  results  \\nand  measures  remove  certain  specified  items  from  revenue,  non inte rest  expenses,  income  taxes  and  non controlling  interests.  Presenting  results  on \\nboth  a reported  basis  and  adjusted  basis  allows  readers  to assess  the  impact  of certain  items  on results  for  the  periods  presented,  and  to better  assess  \\nresults  and  trends  exc luding  those  items  that  may  not  be reflective  of ongoing  business  performance.   \\n \\nAdjusting  items  impacting  results  are  as follows:  \\na) Amortization  of acquisition related  intangible  assets   \\nThese  costs  relate  to the  amortization  of intangible  assets  recognized  upon  the  acquisition  of businesses,  excluding  software,  and  are  recorded  \\nin the  Canadian  Banking,  International  Banking  and  Global  Wealth  Management  operating  segments.  \\n \\nb) Canada  Recovery  Dividend  \\nIn Q1 2023,  the  Bank  recognized  an additional  income  tax  expense  of $579  million  reflecting  the  present  value  of the  amount  payable  for  the  \\nCanada  Recovery  Dividend  (CRD).

Our complete Second Quarter 2024 Report to Shareholders, including our unaudited interim financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2024, can also be found on the SEDAR+ website at www.sedarplus.ca and on the EDGAR section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . Supplementary Financial Information is also available, together with the Second Quarter 2024 Report to Shareholders on the Investor Relations page at www.scotiabank.com . Second Quarter 2024 Highlights on a Reported Basis (versus Q2 2023) Second Quarter 2024 Highlights on an Adjusted Basis(1) (versus Q2 2023) Net income of $2,092 million, compared to $2,146 million Earnings per share (diluted) of $1.57 , compared to $1.68 Return on equity(2) of 11.2 %, compared to 12.2 % Net income of $2,105 million, compared to $2,161 million Earnings per share (diluted) of $1.58 , compared to $1.69 Return on equity of 11.3 %, compared to 12.3 % TORONTO, May 28, 2024 The Bank of Nova Scotia (“Scotiabank”) (TSX: BNS; NYSE: BNS) reported second quarter net income of $2,092 million compared to $2,146 million in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.57 , compared to $1.68 in the same period a year ago . Adjusted net income(1) for the second quarter was $2,105 million and adjusted diluted EPS(1) was $1.58 , down from $1.69 last year. Adjusted return on equity(1) was 11.3 % compared to 12.3% a year ago . “The Bank delivered solid results this quarter against a backdrop of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, reporting positive operating leverage driven by revenue growth and continued expense discipline. We are executing on our commitment to balanced growth as our deposit momentum continues, while maintaining strong capital and liquidity metrics,” said Scott Thomson, President and CEO of Scotiabank. “I am prou d to see Scotiabankers across our global footprint rallying behind our new strategy and coming together to drive our key strategic initiatives forward .” Canadian Banking delivered adjusted earnings(1) of $1 billion this quarter. Solid revenue growth outpaced expense growth resulting in another quarter of positive operating leverage, while provision for credit losses increased compared to the prior year. In addition, deposit growth, a key component of the refreshed strategy, was up 7% year over year . International Banking generated adjusted earnings(1) of $701 million. Revenue growth driven by strong margin expansion , disciplined expense and capital management, were offset by higher provision for credit losses. Adjusted return on equity(1) was 14.5%, a 120 basis point improvement from last year . Global Wealth Management adjusted earnings(1) were $389 million, up 8% year over year. Assets under management(2) of $349 billion increased by 6% resulting in strong revenue growth , partly offset by investments to support long term business growth . Global Banking and Markets reported earnings of $428 million, up 7% compared to the prior year. Results were supported by higher fee based revenue and lower provision for credit losses . The Bank reported a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio(3) of 13.2%, up from 12.3% last year . (1) Refer to Non GAAP Measures section starting on page 6.

Scotiabank Second Quarter Press Release 2024 3 Financial Performance on a Constant Dollar Basis The discussion below on the results of operations is on a constant dollar basis. Under the constant dollar basis, prior period amounts are recalculated using current period average foreign currency rates, which is a non GAAP financial measure (refer to Non GAAP Measures starting on page 6). The Bank believes that constant dollar is useful for readers in assessing ongoing business performance without the impact of foreign currency translation and is used by management to assess the performance of the busines s segment. Q2 2024 vs Q2 2023 Net income attributable to equity holders was $671 million and adjusted net income attributable to equity holders was $677 million, down $12 million or 2%.

Other Q2 2024 vs Q2 2023 Net income attributable to equity holders was a net loss of $421 million, compared to a net loss of $323 million last year. The higher loss of $98 million was due mai nly to lower revenues, partly offset by lower non interest expenses. The decrease in revenue was due mainly to higher funding costs, partly offset by higher income from liquid assets and a lower taxable equivalent basis (TEB) gross up as the Bank no longe r claims the dividend received deduction on Canadian shares that are mark tomarket property.

The provision for credit losses ratio increased 17 basis points to 54 basis points . The provision for credit losses on performing loans was $32 million, compared to $88 million. The provision this quarter was driven by retail portfolio growth, provisions related to migrations in the retail portfolio mainly in Canada and Chile, and the continued unfavourable macroeconomic outlook impacting mainly the commercial portfolios.

Some of these financial measures and ratios are presented on a non GAAP basis and are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which are based on International Financial Repor ting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), are not defined by GAAP and do not have standardized meanings and therefore might not be comparable to similar financial measures and ratios disclosed by other issuers. The Bank believes that non GAAP measures and ratios are useful as they provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses performance. These non GAAP measures and ratios are used throughout this press release and defined below. Adjust ed results and diluted earnings per share Management considers both reported and adjusted results and measures useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. Adjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non inte rest expenses, income taxes and non controlling interests. Presenting results on both a reported basis and adjusted basis allows readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results and trends exc luding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. Adjusting items impacting results are as follows: a) Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets These costs relate to the amortization of intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of businesses, excluding software, and are recorded in the Canadian Banking, International Banking and Global Wealth Management operating segments. b) Canada Recovery Dividend In Q1 2023, the Bank recognized an additional income tax expense of $579 million reflecting the present value of the amount payable for the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD). The CRD is a Canadian federal tax measure which requires the Bank to pay a one time tax of 15% on taxable income in excess of $1 billion, based on the average taxable income for the 2020 and 2021 taxation years. The CRD is payable in equal amounts over five years; however, the present value of these payments was recognized as a liability in the period enacted. This amount was recorded in the Other operating segment.

Reconciliation of International Banking’s reported, adjusted and constant dollar results International Banking business segment results are analyzed on a constant dollar basis which is a non GAAP measure. Under the constant dollar basis, prior period amounts are recalculated using current period average foreign currency rates. The following table presents the reconciliation between reported, adjusted and constant dollar results for International Banking for prior periods. The Bank believes that constant dollar is useful for readers to understand business performance without the impact of foreign currency translation and is used by management to assess the performance of the business segment.

Return on equity Return on equity is a profitability measure that presents the net income attributable to common shareholders (annualized) as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity. Adjusted return on equity is a non GAAP ratio which represents adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (annualized) as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity. Attributed capital and business segment return on equity The amount of common equity allocated to each business segment is referred to as attributed capital. The attribution of capital within each business segment is intended to approximate a percentage of the Basel III common equity capital requirements based on credit, market and operational risks and leverage inherent within each business segment. Attributed capital is a non GAAP measure . Effective November 1, 2023, in line with OSFI’s increased Domestic Stability Buffer announced requirements, the Bank increased the capital attributed to its business lines to approximate 11.5% of the Basel III common equity capital requirements. Previously , capital was attributed based on a methodology that approximated 10.5% of Basel III common equity capital requirements. Return on equity for the business segments is calculated as a ratio of net income attributable to common shareholders (annualized) of the business segment and the capital attributed. This is a non GAAP measure . Adjusted return on equity for the business segments is calculated as a ratio of adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (annualized) of the business segment and the capital attributed.

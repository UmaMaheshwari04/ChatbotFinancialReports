management assesses performance. these non-gaap measures and ratios are used throughout this press release and defined below. adjust ed results and diluted earnings per share management considers both reported and adjusted results and measures useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. adjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expenses, income taxes and non-controlling interests. presenting results on both a reported basis and adjusted basis allows readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results and trends excluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. adjusting items impacting results are as follows: a) amortization of acquisition -related intangible assets these costs relate to the amortization of intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of businesses, excluding software, and are recorded in the canadian banking, international banking and global wealth management operating segments. b) canada recovery dividend in q1 2023, the bank recognized an additional income tax expense of $579 million reflecting the present value of the amount payable for the canada recovery dividend (crd). the crd is a canadian federal tax measure which requires the bank to pay a one-time tax of 15% on taxable income in excess of $1 billion, based on the average taxable income for the 2020 and 2021 taxation years. the crd is payable in equal amounts over five years; however, the present value of these payments was recognized as a liability in the period enacted. this amount was recorded in the other operating segment. 6 scotiabank second quarter press release 2024  \n",

these non-gaap measures and ratios are used throughout this press release and defined below. adjust ed results and diluted earnings per share management considers both reported and adjusted results and measures useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. adjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expenses, income taxes and non-controlling interests. presenting results on both a reported basis and adjusted basis allows readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results and trends excluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. adjusting items impacting results are as follows: a) amortization of acquisition -related intangible assets these costs relate to the amortization of intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of businesses, excluding software, and are recorded in the canadian banking, international banking and global wealth management operating segments. b) canada recovery dividend in q1 2023, the bank recognized an additional income tax expense of $579 million reflecting the present value of the amount payable for the canada recovery dividend (crd). the crd is a canadian federal tax measure which requires the bank to pay a one-time tax of 15% on taxable income in excess of $1 billion, based on the average taxable income for the 2020 and 2021 taxation years. the crd is payable in equal amounts over five years; however, the present value of these payments was recognized as a liability in the period enacted. this amount was recorded in the other operating segment. 6 scotiabank second quarter press release 2024\\nreconciliation of reported and  \n",

measures the bank uses a number of financial measures and ratios to assess its performance, as well as the performance of its operating segments. some of these financial measures and ratios are presented on a non-gaap basis and are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), which are based on international financial repor ting standards (ifrs) as issued by the international accounting standards board (iasb), are not defined by gaap and do not have standardized meanings and therefore might not be comparable to similar financial measures and ratios disclosed by other issuers. the bank believes that non-gaap measures and ratios are useful as they provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses performance. these non-gaap measures and ratios are used throughout this press release and defined below. adjust ed results and diluted earnings per share management considers both reported and adjusted results and measures useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. adjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expenses, income taxes and non-controlling interests. presenting results on both a reported basis and adjusted basis allows readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results and trends excluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. adjusting items impacting results are as follows: a) amortization of acquisition -related intangible assets these costs relate to the amortization of intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of businesses, excluding software, and are recorded in the canadian banking, international banking and global wealth management operating segments. b) canada recovery dividend in q1 2023, the bank recognized an additional income tax expense of $579 million reflecting the present value of the amount payable for the canada recovery dividend (crd). the crd is a canadian federal tax measure which requires the bank to pay a one-time tax of 15% on taxable income in excess of $1 billion, based on the average taxable income for the 2020 and 2021 taxation years. the crd is payable in equal amounts over five years; however, the present value of these payments was recognized as a liability in the period enacted. this amount was recorded in the other operating segment. 6 scotiabank second quarter press release 2024\\nreconciliation of reported and adjusted results and diluted earnings per share

measures the bank uses a number of financial measures and ratios to assess its performance, as well as the performance of its operating segments. some of these financial measures and ratios are presented on a non-gaap basis and are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), which are based on international financial repor ting standards (ifrs) as issued by the international accounting standards board (iasb), are not defined by gaap and do not have standardized meanings and therefore might not be comparable to similar financial measures and ratios disclosed by other issuers. the bank believes that non-gaap measures and ratios are useful as they provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses performance. these non-gaap measures and ratios are used throughout this press release and defined below. adjust ed results and diluted earnings per share management considers both reported and adjusted results and measures useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. adjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expenses, income taxes and non-controlling interests. presenting results on both a reported basis and adjusted basis allows readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results and trends excluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. adjusting items impacting results are as follows: a) amortization of acquisition -related intangible assets these costs relate to the amortization of intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of businesses, excluding software, and are recorded in the canadian banking, international banking and global wealth management operating segments. b) canada recovery dividend in q1 2023, the bank recognized an additional income tax expense of $579 million reflecting the present value of the amount payable for the canada recovery dividend (crd). the crd is a canadian federal tax measure which requires the bank to pay a one-time tax of 15% on taxable income in excess of $1 billion, based on the average taxable income for the 2020 and 2021 taxation years. the crd is payable in equal amounts over five years; however, the present value of these payments was recognized as a liability in the period enacted. this amount was recorded in the other operating segment. 6 scotiabank second quarter press release 2024\\nreconciliation of reported and adjusted results and diluted earnings per share
